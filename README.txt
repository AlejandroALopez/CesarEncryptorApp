To launch the program:

1. Download the files (Go to the green button and press Download ZIP) and make sure the programs and words.txt are in the same folder (Extract the folder from the ZIP into a desired location).

2. Install the Latest Version of Python, if you dont have it. I recommend installing Anaconda.

3. Enter into the folder that contains the progam using the terminar or Command Prompt

4. Write the following: python CesarEncryptor.py

5. It that does not work, try: python3 CesarEncryptor.py
